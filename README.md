My submission for the Shopify [Production Engineer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wir0XQuviR6p-uNEUPzsGvMFwqgMsY8sEjGUx74lNrg/edit) and [Backend Developer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9LZ_kZBUbg-O2MhZVVSqTmvDko5IJWHtuFmIu_Xg1A/edit) technical challenges. 

## Getting Started

There are two options to build and run the program locally. Via `npm` or via `docker`.

### Building and Running the Program Locally

A local installation of `MongoDB` is required for building and running the program. A free community version can be found here: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.

From the root of the project, run:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The program will run on http://localhost:3000.

### Building and Running the Program Locally with Docker

```shell
docker-compose up
```

The program will run on http://localhost:3000.
